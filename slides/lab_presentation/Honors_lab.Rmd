# What is directed forgetting?

- Directed forgetting Effect (DFE) is the ability to selectively remember and forget events

- Has been shown to exist across a number of stimuli, but what about inherently memorable stimuli (i.e. image stimuli)

# Ahmad, Tan & Hockley (2019)

>- Investigated participant's ability to selectively remember or forget images.

>- Small directed forgetting effect for exemplar lures


# Experiment 1 

>- To identify which conditions increase DFE magnitudes for images, we weakened the image stimuli memorability.
