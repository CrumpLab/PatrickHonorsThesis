## The effect of stimulus duration on directed forgetting for pictures

Author: Patrick Ihejirika | Advisor: Matt Crump

Undergraduate Honor's Thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for graduating with Departmental Honors in Psychology.

## Abstract

## Project Information

The goal of {ForgettingPictures} is to share Patrick Ihejirika's honor thesis project as reproducible [vertical project](https://www.crumplab.com/vertical/). 

The purpose of the thesis was to determine whether directed forgetting for pictures would be influenced by changes to decreases in encoding time (stimulus duration) for pictures presented during the encoding phase of recognition memory task.

The honor's thesis is available in pdf form from the manuscript tab. The supplementary materials tab contains our power analysis, and results from two experiments. 

In theory this entire project is shared in a computationally reproducible format. The github repository for this website contains all of the source code for generating the thesis, the original data, the data analysis, and the experiment scripts used to run the experiment.
